A repository of printed circuit board designs and libraries.

Status
======

I make an effort to commit library symbols and footprints that are correct
and have been used in a real design. However, I make no guarantees about
the suitability of symbols and footprints for any purpose. Double-check
everything. Trust no one. :-)
